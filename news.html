                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
                surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;<p>and, as I lie close to
                    the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world
                    among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies,
                    then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that
                    universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and
                    then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul
                    and absorb its power, like the form of a</p>

                The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far away on the left, towards
                Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards
                Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

                <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from
                    Woking also helped to restore </p>
